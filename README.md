# DESCRIPTION ABOUT MY PROJECT

This Java program implements a multithreaded client-server chat application that allows multiple clients to communicate with each other in real time.

The Server listens on port 1234 and accepts multiple client connections.

Each connected client is handled by a separate thread (ClientHandler), enabling simultaneous communication without blocking other users.

The server stores all active clients in a Vector and broadcasts messages to all other clients.

The Client connects to the server and has two threads:

One for sending messages to the server.

Another for receiving messages from the server and displaying them.

This setup uses Javaâ€™s Socket, ServerSocket, BufferedReader, and PrintWriter classes for networking and input/output, and showcases how multithreading enables real-time group chat functionality.
